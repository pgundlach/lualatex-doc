A guide to LuaLaTeX
===================

This document is a map, or touristic guide, for the new world of LuaLaTeX.
Though focusing on LuaLaTeX, it includes relevant information about LuaTeX
with the Plain format, too.

The intended audience ranges from complete newcomers (with a working knowledge
of conventional LaTeX) to package developers. This guide is intended to be
comprehensive in the following sense: it contains pointers to all relevant
sources, gathers information that is otherwise scattered, and adds
introductory material.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement are most welcome.
